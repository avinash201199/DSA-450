/* In this program, we need to find the duplicate characters in the string.
 Example 1 :
 Input : Niket Ranjan
 Output :   â€‚
     Duplicate characters in a given string: 
      a
      n
  Explainatin :
        To find the duplicate character from the string, we need to count the occurrence of each character in the string.
        If count is greater than 1, it implies that a character has a duplicate entry in the string.
